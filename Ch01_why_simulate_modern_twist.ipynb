    "# Chapter 1 — Why simulate (with a modern twist)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Based on chapter 1:** J.C.G. Walker, *Numerical Adventures with Geochemical Cycles*, Oxford University Press, 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The original question\n",
    "\n",
    "When Walker introduced this question (Why simulate?) in 1991, many Earth scientists were sceptical of numerical models. When I as a PhD-student, sometimes around the year 2000, tried to implement Walker's book using `Matlab`, this was still largely true. Our reservations were reasonable: models are simplifications, parameters are uncertain, and a sufficiently clever modeller can make everything fit (the fudge factor).\n",
    "\n",
    "Walker's answer was simple. The Earth system is **coupled**, the atmosphere talks to the ocean, which talks to the biosphere, which talks to the sediments. It is **nonlinear**; doubling CO₂ does not double the ocean's response, because the carbonate buffer fights back. And it operates on **multiple timescales**; the same carbon atom might spend a second in a leaf, a decade in the surface ocean, a millennium in the deep, and a hundred million years in limestone.\n",
    "\n",
    "No back-of-the-envelope calculation can track all of this. You need a model, not because models are perfect, but because your intuition alone is worse. That argument has only grown stronger in thirty-five years."

    "## What has changed since 1991\n",
    "\n",
    "### We now have the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Walker wrote before the Vostok and EPICA ice cores had delivered their 800,000-year records of CO₂ and temperature. Before the Argo float network mapped the ocean's temperature and salinity in three dimensions. Before GRACE satellites weighed the ice sheets from space. Before the Keeling curve at Mauna Loa had crossed 400 ppm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we have access to a myriad observations, although some aspects and regions of the Earth are clearly under-observed (Antarctica and the deep oceans comes to mind). But observations alone do not explain *why*. Why CO₂ was 180 ppm during glacials, why the deep Pacific is older and more nutrient-rich than the deep Atlantic, why the ocean's pH is dropping faster than its DIC is rising. To explore this, we are helped by a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We now have the models\n",
    "\n",
    "Community Earth System Models (CESM) (CESM, GFDL-ESM, UKESM, MPI-ESM) simulate the coupled atmosphere-ocean-land-ice system at resolutions and precisions Walker could not have dreamed of. Intermediate-complexity models like cGENIE and CLIMBER make million-year runs feasible. Biogeochemical models like PISCES and MARBL track dozens of interacting species across the global ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download any of these today, for free, and run them on your laptop (or more likely a cluster). So why would you build your own?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Walker's approach is still important\n",
    "\n",
    "**You don't understand a model until you've built one.** I have learned a lot just by refractor Walker's book into a reasonbly modern computing standard!\n",
    "\n",
    "CESM has roughly two million lines of code. It is a magnificent scientific achievement, but it is not a teaching tool. When you change a parameter and the model responds, you cannot easily trace *why*. The chain of causation passes through a hundred subroutines written by a hundred people over three decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Walker's models have twenty lines of code. When you change the Revelle factor and the airborne fraction shifts, you can see exactly why: the Jacobian changes, the Newton iteration takes one more step, the eigenvalue crosses a threshold. The point is not to compete with CESM. It is to build the intuition that lets you *interpret* CESM."

    "## What has not changed\n",
    "\n",
    "The intellectual structure of geochemical modelling is the same as in 1991. You still need:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reservoirs** — boxes that hold stuff (the atmosphere, the ocean, a sediment layer)\n",
    "2. **Fluxes** — arrows that move stuff between boxes (gas exchange, river input, biological export)\n",
    "3. **Conservation laws** — what goes in must come out (or accumulate)\n",
    "4. **The art of leaving things out** — every model is a caricature; the skill is choosing which features to keep\n",
    "\n",
    "Walker's pedagogical approach was in the *progression*. He starts with one reservoir and one species (Chapter 2), adds more reservoirs (Chapter 3), then nonlinearity (Chapter 4), then real chemistry (Chapter 5), then isotopes (Chapter 6), then spatial structure (Chapter 7), and finally couples everything together (Chapter 8). At each step, the model becomes more realistic, and the numerical method becomes more sophisticated to match.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you have built, from scratch, a model that captures the essential physics of the ocean carbon cycle. It is crude by modern standards, but it is quite easy to understand. And that understanding is what helps you read a CESM paper and know whether to trust it."

    "## The modern twist: transparent and reproducible\n",
    "\n",
    "Walker wrote his code using tools of the time, `BASIC` or `FORTRAN`  and published it as printed listings in the appendix. To run it, you had to type it in, compile it, and hope you hadn't introduced a typo.\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks are different. Code, explanation, equations, and figures live side by side. You can change a parameter and re-run a cell in seconds. You can see the Jacobian, watch the Newton iterations converge, plot the eigenvalues all without leaving the document. All is available and version controlled as an open repository. This is Walker's philosophy taken to its logical conclusion: complete transparency. The model is the notebook is the explanation."
