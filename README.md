Jupyter notebook modernization of James A. Walker book "Numerical Adventures with Geochemical Cycles

Numerical Adventures with Geochemical Cycles

Overview

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that translate and modernize the numerical simulations from Numerical Adventures with Geochemical Cycles by James C. G. Walker. These simulations explore fundamental processes in geochemistry, climate evolution, and Earth's carbon cycle using Python.

Structure

The repository follows a modular structure where each chapter's numerical model is rewritten in Python and explained in detail.

notebooks/ - Collection of Jupyter notebooks for different chapters.

data/ - Any input datasets required for the simulations.

scripts/ - Additional Python scripts for modular functions.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries:

pip install numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter

Running the Notebooks

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/numerical-geochemical-cycles.git
cd numerical-geochemical-cycles

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Open and run the relevant notebooks from the notebooks/ directory.

Notebooks

Completed Chapters

CO₂ Exchange Simulation (notebooks/co2_exchange_simulation.ipynb)

Models the exchange of atmospheric CO₂ using explicit and implicit Euler methods, as well as SciPy's solve_ivp.

Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you would like to add improvements or additional simulations, feel free to submit a pull request.
