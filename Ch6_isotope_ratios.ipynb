    "\n",
    "Isotope ratios are among the most powerful tools in geochemistry; they trace the origin and history of carbon, oxygen, sulfur, and other elements through the Earth system. But they require special treatment in numerical models because, as Walker emphasises, **isotope ratios are not conserved**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mass is conserved: if you mix two reservoirs, the total mass is the sum. But isotope *ratios* are not additive, they are weighted by mass. This means we need to derive new equations for the rate of change of isotope ratios, and these equations contain extra terms beyond the simple mass balance.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Exercise 6.4:** Explore Walker's lagoon model with temperature-dependent fractionation: $\\epsilon(T) = -9.3 + 0.05T$ (°C). Add a seasonal temperature cycle and show how the isotopic record in carbonate sediments encodes both temperature and evaporation signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 6.5:** The \"disequilibrium flux\" — the atmosphere and ocean are never in isotopic equilibrium because the ocean's δ¹³C is always lagging behind the atmosphere's. Compute the disequilibrium flux of ¹³C as a function of time and show that it partly offsets the Suess effect."
